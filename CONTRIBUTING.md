# Contributions to this Mod are welcome!

## To Contribute
Make any changes and open a Pull Request.  In your Pull Request please specify how you tested these changes.  E.g.
"This is a diologue tweak.  I went to the tavern and talked to the lady and verifies the text said..."

### Issues
If a PR references a particular Github issue please link to the issue in the PR.  Also these PR's will be merged more quickly than other PRs

## Plot Consistency
Please look to the Readme.md for the outline.  While I'm open to changes in the general format, they should be pre-approved, and would need to also be specified in the Readme.md

### Side Quests
I love any ideas that fork off of the orginal story.  If your change is a side quest please specify.

## Adult Content
It's my intention to release three versions.  A PG-13 version (sex implied), an R version (sex described), and a XXX version (SexLab)
The intention is to have all 'sex' actions dispatch to a 'RM_getsex' function (of some sort) which can then itself cascade.
