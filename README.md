# Romancing-of-Markarth
A Social Politicall and Romance mod for Skyrim


## Live Another Life
This mod is intended to have LAL hooks and non-Lal hooks.  The sections Part 0 and Part 6 are intended exclusively as LAL hooks.

## Part 0: (I was just a Poor Farm Hand)
Background: You grew up as a farmhand, you live with a woman you call 'gran'.  She's not your real grandmother, but she's raised you like her own child.

Start in Chillfurrow Farm

New Character Sotteta Fryfnhil - Old woman, high relationship value with PC

Harvest the fields (get 10 cabbage and 7 wheat)

Return Cabbage

Create 2 Sacks of Flour

Return Flour

Go into Whiterun to sell Flour and Cabbage

While in the city a battleborn stops you and threatens your life

Return to Sotteta, she says it's time to move on. 
  - But I don't want to
  - Yes, that'd be for the best

You're going to need to make a life for yourself.

You're pretty, and you could marry well.  The Treasury House in Markarth is hosting a party, and I have an invitation.

You should take my invitation and go, establish yourself and marry up.

First, you'll need to find a way to get some clothes, and earn enough money for a carriage ride.

Here take this item, it's a family heirloom and will help you.

### (alternate hook)
  Someone approaches and offers an invitation, and suggests that they find appropriate clothes.
   
## Part 1: (Get to the Party)
  Get some clothes
  
  Clothes either substandard (armor), fine, or sexy - Affects future choices.
  
  Ride cart to Markarth
  
  Talk to ...
 
## Part 2 (Getting to know you)
  Get to know the characters at a party.  There are 6 (3 men, 3 women) people to court of various station and attractivness who have different agendas
  
  Possibly different ways to behave and show off at the party.
  
  ???
  
  Complete Quests that help with these characters agendas
  
  When relationship is high enough, the romantic interest will say "let's go somewhere private"
  
  (Each relationship has a lust and a love aspect - lust increases the likelihood of "let's go somewhere private", but doing that drops the lust factor)
  
  (Love increases more quickly when lust is high)
  
  (The PC's goal is to balance Lust - which motivates the character to engage and accept requests from the PC, and Love which can lead to marriage)

### Quests
  Need a list of quests to accomplish here

### Characters
  Need 2 rivals ( a male and a female )
  
  A friend (who helps the character), possibly a handmaiden
  
  Need 6 possible love interests.
   - A high status unattractive woman (medium)
   - A high status attractive woman (hardest)
   - A lower status attractive woman (easiest)
   - A high status unattractive man (medium)
   - A high status attractive man (hardest)
   - a lower status attractive man (easiest)
  
## Part 3 (Meeting with Dibella)
  After the first "let's go somewhere private" the pc is summoned to the Temple of DIbella

  The PC is told that (s)he's got to be careful as (s)he's playing with the heartstrings or multiple people
  
  However is (s)he is genuine (s)he can gain an Amulet of Dibella, and if (s)he has chosen a partner (s)he can gain the Amulet of Mara
 
## Part 4 (Sealing the Deal)
  More relationships advance and more characters say "let's go somewhere private".
  
  However as each relationship advances that character has a greater likelihood of following you around (like shopkeepers)
  
  If a lover catches you 'alone' with someone else a brawls will begin against you and who you were with.
  
  If a lover catches you 'alone' with someone else, your relationship with them will be ruined, and their 'questline' wil be lost.
  
  As each relationship progresses the PC has the capacity to 'supplant' that characters duties. The PC starts making the decisions.  This escalates.
  
  Eventually this leads to 'will you marry me'. 
  
  If the PC says yes, and they actually marry, the PC gains an estate of a size dependant upon the character they marry.
  
  This is not an ordinary wedding, and the PC accomplish several feats to have the marriage arranged in Solitude.
 
## Part 5 (The Marriage)
  The Marriage.  Unfortunately a marriage rival (this sort of thing needs to happen in the Quest 2 Stages) will try to sabatoge the affair.
  
  A friend makes this known to the PC.  That person must be killed, bribed, persuaded, intimidated out of it.  Or ruined by finding damning evidence.
  
  If the wedding starts, and she is there, she'll object when there's an annoucement and show a document showing that the PC is a bastard child of a whore.
  
  If the Love value is not high enough, then the wedding is off and all objectives are failed.
  
  Additionally, any other character the PC has been with with a high enough love score will try to stop the wedding. 
  
  The other lovers need to individually be handled (mini-quests) to keep them from objecting.
 
Part 6 (The Journey Home)
  After the wedding, the PC has an estate and wealth.  (s)he can return to Sotteta to lift her out of poverty.
  
  Upon returning Sotteta is on her death bed.  She expresses how proud she is.  Tells the PC "Now that you have achieved this, you can do so much more."
  
  "Go and help your brothers and sisters in Skyrim - these are dark times, and I fear that now you are the only one who can save us all"
